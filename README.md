# Hey-Day-Script

## About

Hey Day is one of longest and most loved traditions on Auburn University's campus. Every year, Auburn University's student body will hand out name tags and encourage students, faculty, and the rest of the Auburn Family to greet one another with the Auburn Spirit in an effort to bring all of Auburn closer together.
